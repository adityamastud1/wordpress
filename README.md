# CodeSmashers

This is a website, created using wordpress. Theme is 'CodeSmashers', a 'coding tutorial site'. It was developed on the local-server. No domain nor any database server has been rented. So, the website will run only on the administrator's local machine. 

## Run Locally

To run the project locally, do the following:

Clone the project down to your local machine. 

```bash
  git clone https://https://github.com/adityamastud1/wordpress/

```
1. Download the following application:
  XAMPP: XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server possible. ``` https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html ```

2. Now, link the downloaded XAMPP to the cloned wordpress repository, by copying the contents from the folder, and then pasting them in the following local path: ```C:\xampp\htdocs``` .

3. Open the XAMPP control panel, and click the start button in front of the "MySQL" and "Apache" tabs. This will start the local SQL database. 

4. Lastly, open your browser, and simply type ```localhost/wordpress/ ``` . This will open the web page. 
## Techstacks used:
  mySQL -> To create the local database.  
  PHP -> The main scripting language used by wordpress.   
  vanilla CSS -> Some extra CSS was used to beautify the website.
